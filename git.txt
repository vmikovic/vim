If you just used git init and have added your 
files with git add . or something similar and
have added your remote branch it might be that 
you just haven't committed (git commit -m 'commit message') 
anything locally to push to the remote... 
I just had this error and that was my issue.



I had the same problem. I was getting this problem because 
I had not made any commits, not even an initial commit 
and still I was trying to push.
Once I did git commit -m "your msg", everything worked fine.

git branch -m new-name
git push -u new-name



    git init

    git remote add origin https://gitlab.com/crew-chief-systems/bot

    git remote -v (for checking current repository)

    git add -A(add all files)

    git commit -m 'Added my project'

    git pull --rebase origin master

    git push  origin master
